# Development Workflow

## Quick Start

1. **Make changes** to React components in `src/`
2. **Build the extension**: `npm run build`
3. **Reload the extension** in your browser:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/` (or `edge://extensions/`)
   - Click the reload icon on the extension card
   - Open the popup to see changes

## Development Modes

### One-time Build
```bash
npm run build
```
Builds the extension once. Use this when you're done making changes.

### Watch Mode (Auto-rebuild)
```bash
npm run build:watch
```
Automatically rebuilds whenever you save changes to files in `src/`. You'll still need to manually reload the extension in the browser.

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Always run `npm run build` after making React/UI changes**

The extension uses the **built files** (`popup.js`, `popup.css`), not the source files. The `popup.html` file must reference the built files:
- ✅ `./popup.js` (built)
- ✅ `./popup.css` (built)
- ❌ `/src/main.jsx` (source - only for dev server)

## File Structure

```
how-much/
├── src/              # React source files (edit these)
│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── main.jsx
│   └── components/
├── popup.html        # Extension popup HTML (references built files)
├── popup.js          # Built JavaScript (generated by Vite)
├── popup.css         # Built CSS (generated by Vite)
└── manifest.json     # Extension manifest
```

## Troubleshooting

**Extension showing old UI?**
1. Make sure you ran `npm run build`
2. Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions/`
3. Close and reopen the extension popup
4. If still stuck, try a hard refresh (right-click extension icon → Inspect popup → Hard reload)

**Build not updating?**
- Check that you're editing files in `src/`
- Make sure `popup.html` references `./popup.js` (not `/src/main.jsx`)
- Check the terminal for build errors
