# Design System - shadcn/ui

## Design System Reference

**Use the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) design system as the foundation for all UI components and styling.**

### Installation & Reference

- **Installation Docs**: 
  - Main installation: [https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation)
  - Next.js specific: [https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next)
  - React Router: [https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/react-router](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/react-router)
  - React 19 compatibility: [https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/react-19](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/react-19)
- **Note**: The official installation uses React frameworks (Next.js 15, React Router, React 19, etc.), but this browser extension uses vanilla JavaScript
- **Adaptation**: Adapt shadcn/ui React components to vanilla JS/HTML for browser extension use
- **Component Reference**: Use the React framework installations as references for component structure, but convert React/JSX to vanilla JavaScript
- **React 19 Note**: While React 19 compatibility info is for React projects, it's useful for understanding component patterns and design system updates

### Core Principles

- **Open Source, Open Code**: shadcn/ui provides components you can customize, extend, and build on
- **Component-Based**: Use shadcn/ui components as building blocks for the UI
- **Consistent Styling**: Follow shadcn/ui design tokens and patterns for consistency

### Component Usage

When creating or updating UI components:

1. **Check shadcn/ui first**: Before building custom components, check if shadcn/ui has a component that fits
2. **Reference the documentation**: Use [https://ui.shadcn.com](https://ui.shadcn.com) for:
   - Component examples (adapt React components to vanilla JS)
   - Design patterns
   - Color schemes
   - Typography
   - Spacing and layout
3. **Installation reference**: Use [https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation) as a guide for:
   - Component structure and patterns
   - Styling approach
   - Design tokens

### Browser Extension Considerations

Since this is a browser extension with CSP (Content Security Policy) restrictions:

- **Framework adaptation**: This is a vanilla JS extension, not Next.js - adapt React components from shadcn/ui
- **Inline styles**: Components may need to be adapted with inline styles for CSP compliance
- **No external CDNs**: Include shadcn/ui styles and patterns directly in the extension
- **Self-contained**: All design system code should be bundled with the extension
- **No React dependencies**: Convert React/JSX components to vanilla JS/HTML

### Design Tokens

Follow shadcn/ui design tokens for:
- Colors (background, foreground, primary, muted, destructive, etc.)
- Border radius
- Shadows
- Spacing (padding, margins)
- Typography scales

### Example Components Available

shadcn/ui provides components such as:
- Buttons
- Inputs
- Select/Dropdown
- Cards
- Forms
- Dialogs
- And many more...

Reference the [shadcn/ui documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com) for the full component library.

### Implementation Pattern

When implementing shadcn/ui components:
1. Review the component documentation on shadcn/ui
2. Adapt the component code to work within browser extension CSP constraints
3. Ensure styles are self-contained (no external dependencies)
4. Maintain consistency with shadcn/ui design patterns
