# Cursor Rules for how-much project

## Git Commit Behavior
- On every code change, automatically commit to the current branch
- **Exception**: Do NOT auto-commit if the current branch is `main` or `master`
- Use descriptive commit messages that explain what was changed
- Commit messages should be in present tense (e.g., "Add feature X" not "Added feature X")

## Commit Message Format
- Start with a verb: Add, Fix, Update, Refactor, Remove, etc.
- Be concise but descriptive
- Include relevant context when helpful

## Examples
- "Add currency formatting for BRL locale"
- "Fix number parsing for European format"
- "Update popup UI with shadcn components"
- "Refactor content script for better performance"

## When NOT to commit
- When on `main` branch (requires manual review)
- When only documentation changes (unless explicitly requested)
- When changes are incomplete or broken

## Project Rules

Additional project-specific rules are organized in separate files in `.cursor/rules/`:
- **Design System**: See `.cursor/rules/design-system.mdc` for shadcn/ui design system guidelines
- **Currency Punctuation**: See `.cursor/rules/currency-punctuation.mdc` for detailed rules on handling different number formats when parsing prices
